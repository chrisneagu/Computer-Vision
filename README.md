# Gameplay 

  Basically, the player spawns in the middle left of the screen and has to avoid the ghosts (marked with a circle as a radius to follow the player) and also the walls blocking his movement.
  - if the player is in radius of a ghost that ghost will follow him
  - if the player was in the radius of a ghost but its not anymore the other ghosts will patrol with double speed
  - otherwise they will just normaly patrol automatically
  - the player can hold shift for sprint (double speed)

  The scope of the game is that the player reaches the door without getting caught, like a classic Pac Man game. In addition the program also generates a decision tree based on our game model decisions and home made datasets.
